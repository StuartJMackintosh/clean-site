Sure, here are some HTML examples of best practices for optimal search engine ranking:

1. Use descriptive and relevant page titles:

```html
<head>
  <title>Best Practice for Optimal Search Engine Ranking</title>
</head>
```

1. Use heading tags to structure your content:

```html
<body>
  <h1>Best Practice for Optimal Search Engine Ranking</h1>
  <h2>1. Use descriptive and relevant page titles</h2>
  <p>Your page title should accurately reflect the content of your page and include relevant keywords.</p>
  <h2>2. Include meta descriptions</h2>
  <p>Your meta description should provide a brief summary of your page's content and include relevant keywords.</p>
</body>
```

1. Use alt attributes for images:


```html
<img src="example.jpg" alt="Example image of best practice for optimal search engine ranking">

```
1. Use semantic HTML:

```html
<body>
  <header>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
        <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>
  <main>
    <section>
      <h1>Best Practice for Optimal Search Engine Ranking</h1>
      <p>Your content goes here.</p>
    </section>
  </main>

</body>

```

By following these best practices, you can improve your website's visibility in search engine results and potentially attract more traffic to your site.


> what other meta headers can be used to optimise SEO ranking?

In addition to the meta title and meta description, there are several other meta headers that can be used to optimize SEO ranking. Here are some examples:

1. Meta Keywords:

This header used to be a popular way to tell search engines what keywords your page was about, but is not considered as important anymore. Nevertheless, some search engines still look at this tag.

```html
<head>
  <meta name="keywords" content="best practice, SEO, ranking">
</head>
```



1. Canonical Tag:
This header tells search engines which version of a page is the preferred version if there are multiple versions of a page with similar or identical content, such as a mobile version and a desktop version.


```html
<head>
  <link rel="canonical" href="https://example.com/page" />
</head>
```

1. Robots Tag:
This header tells search engine crawlers which pages to index and which pages to avoid indexing.

```html
<head>
  <meta name="robots" content="index, follow">
</head>
```

1. Open Graph Tag:
This header is used to optimize the display of your page on social media platforms by specifying the title, description, and image to be displayed when someone shares your page on social media.

```html
<head>
  <meta property="og:title" content="Best Practice for Optimal Search Engine Ranking">
  <meta property="og:description" content="Learn the best practices for optimal search engine ranking and improve your website's visibility in search engine results.">
  <meta property="og:image" content="https://example.com/image.jpg">
</head>

```
It's important to note that while meta headers can help optimize SEO ranking, they are just one part of a larger SEO strategy that also includes quality content, appropriate use of keywords, and a well-designed website with a good user experience.
